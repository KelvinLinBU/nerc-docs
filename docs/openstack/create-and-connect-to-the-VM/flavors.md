# Nova flavors

In NERC OpenStack, flavors define the compute, memory, and storage capacity of
nova computing instances. In other words, a flavor is an available hardware
configuration for a server.

The important fields are

| Field      | Description                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| RAM        | Memory size in MB                                |
| Disk       | Size of disk in GB                               |
| Ephemeral  | Size of a second disk. 0 means no second disk is defined and mounted.   |
| VCPUs      | Number of virtual cores                          |

## Currently, our setup supports and offers the following flavors

NERC offers the following flavors based on our Infrastructure-as-a-Service
(IaaS) - OpenStack offerings (Tiers of Service).

!!! tip "Pro Tip"

    Choose a flavor for your instance from the available Tier that suits your requirements, use-cases, and budget when launching a VM.

### 1. Standard Compute Tier

The standard compute flavor **"cpu-su"** is provided from Lenovo SD530 (2x Intel
8268 2.9 GHz, 48 cores, 384 GB memory) server. The base unit is 1 vCPU, 4 GB
memory with default of 20 GB root disk at a rate of $0.013 / hr of wall time.

### 3. GPU Tier

!!! info "Information"

    NERC also supports the most demanding workloads including Artificial Intelligence
    (AI), Machine Learning (ML) training and Deep Learning modeling, simulation, data
    analytics, data visualization, distributed databases, and more. For such demanding
    workloads, the NERCâ€™s GPU-based distributed computing flavor is recommended, which
    is integrated into a specialized hardware such as GPUs that produce unprecedented
    performance boosts for technical computing workloads.

There are three flavors within the GPU tier, one featuring the newer
**NVidia A100s** along with **NVidia V100s** and **NVidia K80s**.

The **"gpu-su-a100"** flavor is provided from Lenovo SR670 (2x Intel 8268 2.9 GHz,
48 cores, 384 GB memory, 4x NVidia A100) servers. These latest GPUs deliver
industry-leading high throughput and low latency networking. The base unit is 24
vCPU, 95 GB memory with default of 20 GB root disk at a rate of $1.803 / hr of
wall time.

| Flavor        | SUs | GPU | vCPU  | RAM(GB) | Storage(GB) | Cost / hr |
|---------------|-----|-----|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|
|gpu-su-a100.1  |1    |1    |24     |74       |20           |$1.803     |
|gpu-su-a100.2  |2    |2    |48     |148      |20           |$3.606     |

!!! note "How to setup NVIDIA driver for **"gpu-su-a100"** flavor based VM?"
    After launching a VM with an **NVidia A100** GPU flavor, you will need to
    setup the NVIDIA driver in order to use GPU-based codes and libraries.
    Please run the following commands to setup the NVIDIA driver and CUDA
    version required for these flavors in order to execute GPU-based codes.
    **Note:** These commands are **ONLY** applicable for the VM based on
    "**ubuntu-22.04-x86_64**" image. You might need to find corresponding
    packages for your own OS of choice.

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt -y install nvidia-driver-495
        # Just click *Enter* if any popups appear!
        # Confirm and verify that you can see the NVIDIA device attached to your VM
        lspci | grep -i nvidia
        # 0:05.0 3D controller: NVIDIA Corporation GA100 [A100 PCIe 40GB] (rev a1)
        sudo reboot
        # SSH back to your VM and then you will be able to use nvidia-smi command
        nvidia-smi

The **"gpu-su-v100"** flavor is provided from Dell R740xd (2x Intel Xeon Gold 6148,
40 core, 768GB memory, 1x NVidia V100) servers. The base unit is 48 vCPU, 192 GB
memory with default of 20 GB root disk at a rate of $1.214 / hr of wall time.

## How to Change Flavor of an instance

!!! warn "Important Note"
    This is only possible using the openstack client at this time!

**Prerequisites**:

To run the OpenStack CLI commands, you need to have:

- OpenStack CLI setup, see
[OpenStack Command Line setup](../openstack-cli/openstack-CLI.md#command-line-setup)
for more information.

If you want to change the **flavor** that is bound to a VM, then you can run the
following openstack client commands, here we are changing flavor of an existing
VM i.e. named "test-vm" from `mem-su.2` to `mem-su.4`:

First, stop the running VM using:

    openstack server stop test-vm

Then, verify the status is "SHUTOFF" and also the used flavor is `mem-su.2` as
shown below:

    openstack server list
    +--------------------------------------+------+---------+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------+---------+
    | ID | Name | Status | Networks | Image | Flavor |
    +--------------------------------------+------+---------+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------+---------+
    | cd51dbba-fe95-413c-9afc-71370be4d4fd | test-vm | SHUTOFF | default_network=192.168.0.58, 199.94.60.10 | N/A (booted from volume) | mem-su.2 |
    +--------------------------------------+------+---------+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------+---------+

Then, resize the flavor from `mem-su.2` to `mem-su.4` by running:

    openstack server resize --flavor mem-su.4 cd51dbba-fe95-413c-9afc-71370be4d4fd

Confirm the resize:

    openstack server resize confirm cd51dbba-fe95-413c-9afc-71370be4d4fd

Then, start the VM:

    openstack server start cd51dbba-fe95-413c-9afc-71370be4d4fd

Verify the VM is using the new flavor of `mem-su.4` as shown below:

    openstack server list
    +--------------------------------------+------+--------+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------+---------+
    | ID | Name | Status | Networks | Image | Flavor |
    +--------------------------------------+------+--------+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------+---------+
    | cd51dbba-fe95-413c-9afc-71370be4d4fd | test-vm | ACTIVE | default_network=192.168.0.58, 199.94.60.10 | N/A (booted from volume) | mem-su.4 |
    +--------------------------------------+------+--------+--------------------------------------------+--------------------------+---------+
