# Create a Router

A router acts as a gateway for external connectivity.

By connecting your private network to the public network via a router, you can
connect your instance to the Internet,
install packages, etc. without needing to associate it with a public IP address.

You can view routers by clicking Project, then click Network panel and choose
Routers from the tabs that appears.

Click "Create Network" button on the right side of the screen.

In the Create Router dialog box, specify a name for the router.

From the External Network dropdown, select the 'provider' network, and click
"Create Router" button. This will set the Gateway for the new router to public network.

The new router is now displayed in the Routers tab. You should now see the
router in the Network Topology view. (It also appears under Project -> Network
-> Routers).

Notice that it is now connected to the public network, but not your private network.

interface for the selected subnet.

If you choose not to set the IP Address value, then by default OpenStack
Networking uses the first host IP address in the subnet.

The Router Name and Router ID fields are automatically updated.

d. Click "Add Interface".

The Router will now appear connected to the private network in Network Topology tab.
