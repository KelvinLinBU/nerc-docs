    Python SDK is a client library for building applications to work with
    OpenStack clouds. The project aims to provide a consistent and complete set of
    interactions with OpenStack's many services, along with complete documentation,
    examples, and tools.

If you need to plug OpenStack into existing scripts using another language,
there are a variety of other SDKs at various levels of active development.

A list of known SDKs is maintained on the official OpenStack wiki.
