# Billing Process for My Institution

## Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

The New England Research Cloud (NERC) is a shared service offered through the
Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC). The MGHPCC will
enter into a lightweight Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with each institutional
customer that consumes NERC services. The MOU is intended to ensure the institution
maintains access to valuable and relevant cloud services provided by the MGHPCC
via the NERC to be better aligned to a number of research regulations, policies,
and requirements and also ensure NERC remains sustainable over time.

## Institutions with established MOUs and Billing Processes

For cost recovery purposes, institutional customers may elect to receive one invoice
for the usage of NERC services by its PIs and cost recovery internally. Every month,
the NERC team will export, back up, and securely store the billing data for all
PIs in the form of comma-separated values (CSV) files and provide it to the MGHPCC
for billing purposes.

The following institutions using our services have established MOU as well as
billing processes with us:

1. [Harvard University](billing-process-for-harvard.md)

2. [Boston University](billing-process-for-bu.md)

!!! info "Upcoming MOU with other institutions"
    We are in the process of establishing MOUs for institutions not listed above.

PIs from other institutions not listed above can still utilize NERC services with
the understanding that they are directly accountable for managing their usage and
ensuring all service charges are paid promptly. If you have any some common
questions or need further information, see our [Billing FAQs](billing-faqs.md)
for comprehensive answers.

If your institution does not have an MOU with us, please have someone from your
faculty or administration contact us to discuss it soon by emailing us at
[help@nerc.mghpcc.org](mailto:help@nerc.mghpcc.org?subject=NERC%20MOU%20Question)
or, by submitting a new ticket at [the NERC's Support Ticketing System](https://mghpcc.supportsystem.com/open.php).
