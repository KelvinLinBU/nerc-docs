# Billing Process for Boston University

Boston University has elected to receive a centralized invoice for its university
investigators and their designated user's use of NERC services. IS&T will then
internally recover the cost from investigators. The process for cost recovery is
currently being implemented, and we will reach out to investigators once the process
is complete to obtain internal funding information to process your monthly bill.

## Subsidization of Boston University's Use of NERC

Boston University will subsidize a portion of NERC usage by its investigators.
The University will subsidize $100 per month of an investigator's total usage on
NERC, regardless of the number of NERC projects an investigator has established.
Monthly subsidies cannot be carried over to subsequent months. The subsidized
amount and method are subject to change, and any adjustments will be conveyed
directly to investigators and updated on this page.
