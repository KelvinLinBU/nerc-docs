# NERC Pricing Calculator

The NERC Pricing Calculator is a google excel based tool for estimating the cost
of utilizing various NERC resources in different NERC service offerings. It offers
a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input their requirements and customize
configurations to generate accurate and tailored cost estimates for optimal
budgeting and resource allocation.

    Please Note, you need to make a copy of this tool before estimating the
    cost and once copied you can easily update corresponding resource type columns'
    values on your own working sheet that will reflect your potential Service
    Units (SU), Rate, and cost per Hour, Month and Year. This tool has 4 sheets
    at the bottom as shown here:

    If you are more interested to calculate your cost estimates based on the available
    **NERC OpenStack flavors** (which define the compute, memory, and storage capacity
    for your dedicated instances), you can select and use the second sheet titled
    "**OpenStack Flavor**". For cost estimating the NERC OpenShift resources,
    you can use the first sheet titled "**Calculate SU**" and input pod specific
    resource requests in each row. If you are scaling the pods more than one then
    you need to enter a new row or entry for each scaled pods. For Storage cost,
    you need to use the third sheet titled "**Calculate Storage**". And then the
    overall total cost will be reflected at the last sheet titled "**Total Cost**".
