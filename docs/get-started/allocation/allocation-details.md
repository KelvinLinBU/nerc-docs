# Allocation details

Access to ColdFront's allocations details is based on [user roles](manage-users-to-a-project.md#user-roles).
PIs and managers see the same allocation details as users, and can also add
project users to the allocation, if they're not already on it, and remove users
from an allocation.

## PI and Manager View

PIs and managers can view important details of the project and underlying
allocations. It shows all allocations including start and end dates, creation
and last modified dates, users on the allocation and public allocation attributes.
PIs and managers can add or remove users from allocations.

## General User View

General Users who are not PIs or Managers on a project see a read-only view of the
allocation details. If a user is on a project but not a particular allocation, they
will not be able to see the allocation in the Project view nor will they be able
to access the Allocation detail page.
