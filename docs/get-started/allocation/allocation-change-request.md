PI or project managers can provide a new value for the individual quota attributes,
and give justification for the requested changes so that the NERC admin can review
the change request and approve or deny based on justification and quota change request.
Then submitting the change request, this will notify the NERC admin about it. Please
wait untill the NERC admin approves/ deny the change request to see the change on
your resource allocation for the selected project.

!!! info "Information"
    PI or project managers can put the new values on the textboxes for **ONLY**
    quota attributes they want to change others they can be left **blank** so those
    quotas will not get changed!

Once the request is processed by the NERC admin, any user can view that request change
trails for the project by looking at the "Allocation Change Requests" section that
looks like below:
